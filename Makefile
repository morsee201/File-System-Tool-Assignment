# C++ Modular Make File

# Using this =Makefile* (Org mode comment: =...= means code)
#
# This =Makefile= represents an attempt to support both "convention over
# configuration" and "folder-based modules" in standard C++ projects.
#
# Convention
#
# Below the folder containing this =Makefile= lies a =src/=
# folder. That folder contains the modules for this C++ project, each
# in a directory that should be named for the module. The =src/=
# folder also has =allModule.mk=, a file included into this
# =Makefile=.
#
# =allModule.mk= defines two lists: =MODULES= and =BOOT=. =MODULES= is
# a space-separated list of the modules' folder names. =BOOT= is
# similar but only lists modules that should be compiled into flat
# binary files (like a bootloader, hence the name).
#
# Each module must contain a different include file for =make=,
# =module.mk=. There are three (3) versions of =module.mk=:
# tools :: in the executables directory. Each compilable file is
#   compiled/assembled and then linked with all other object files
#   (except those in the tools directory) into an executable program.
# boot :: in the boot loader directory. Each compilable file is
#   compiled/assembled directly into a flat binary file.  The linker
#   is never run.
# default :: for all other modules, compilable files are built into
#   object files and added to the link list for executable files.
